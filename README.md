# EPN_Research

We consider an Energy Packet Network (EPN) model where the service times of the packets follow a Coxian distributions. <br>
EPNs are a recent type of models to study the interactions between energy consumption and the processing of jobs or the transmission of
data. We prove that such a network have a product form solution for its steady-state distribution. We also state some sufficient
conditions for the existence of the flow equations. Finally we study the performances and the energy consumption and we
show how to optimize such a system in Tree topology [1] and Star tolopology [2].
