Enerrgy Packets Network


We consider an Energy Packet Network (EPN)
model where the service times of the packets follow a Coxian
distributions. EPNs are a recent type of models proposed by Ge-
lenbe and his colleagues to study the interactions between energy
consumption and the processing of jobs or the transmission of
data. We prove that such a network have a product form solution
for its steady-state distribution. We also state some sufficient
conditions for the existence of the flow equations. Finally we
study the performances and the energy consumption and we
show how to optimize such a system
